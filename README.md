# Blue-Stats-Minecraft
Blue Stats 3 is a complete remake/recode of Blue Stats.
Blue Stats 3 uses a mysql backend to save and load configuartions, caches and other things to make Blue Stats even more powerfull.

With making this webapp, I have kept customizability, ease of use and power in mind. This tool is extremely easy to install and get going.
