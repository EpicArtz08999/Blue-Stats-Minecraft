# Blue-Stats-Minecraft
Blue Stats 3 is a complete remake/recode of Blue Stats.
Blue Stats 3 uses a mysql backend to save and load configuartions, caches and other things to make Blue Stats even more powerfull.

With making this webapp, I have kept customizability, ease of use and power in mind. This tool is extremely easy to install and get going.

Missing features
=====================
Admin interface     
Loggin with minecraft (Maybe)     
Graphs api     
Graphs     
Server query and ping     
ID based player instead of uuid based player (Makes it easier to use more then one plugin on per player stats)
