#Reporting Bugs

A bug is when the software does not behave in a way that is expected. It is not invalid configurations which render the stats page broken.

If you believe you have located a bug, please report it to the (Bug Tracker)[https://github.com/robinp7720/Blue-Stats-Minecraft/issues].

Please make sure there is not an issue for your specific bug already! If you find that someone else has reported a bug you have, please comment on that issue stating you have replicated that bug. Do not make a new issue.

When submitting those bugs, follow these standards:

    The title of the issue should clearly and quickly explain the issue. A good title would be "Cannot view player page if their name is over 32 characters".
    The description should contain the following information
        A complete description of the problem. This should explain what you expect the panel to do and what the panel actually did.
        Steps to reproduce the bug. It is hard to figure out what the bug truly is if we cannot do it ourselves.
